Social Media Image Templates for the School of AI Global Community
## Next Steps
Flesh-out the code in this repo so that a Dean may generate all of their Social Media images at the click of a button.

## Feature Development
1. Place a large resolution image in a folder called 'source_images'
2. Run the script
3. The folder 'generated_images' is populated with the following images:
  * Facebook Fan Page Header Image (315px x 851px)
  * Facebook Fan Page Square Image (160px x 160px)
  * Facebook Group Cover Photo (1640px x 856px)
