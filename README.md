# School of AI: Universal Social Media Graphic Generator
Social Media Image Templates for the School of AI Global Community
## Next Steps
Flesh-out the code in this repo so that all that a dean has to do is place a single image into the `source_images` folder, run the script, enter their *city name* and hit generate. That will create all the required graphics in the dimensions listed below:

## Feature Development
1. Place a large resolution image in a folder called 'source_images'
2. Run the script
3. The folder 'generated_images' is populated with the following images:
  * Facebook Fan Page Header Image (315px x 851px)
  * Facebook Fan Page Square Image (160px x 160px)
  * Facebook Group Cover Photo (1640px x 856px)
  * Twitter Profile Header (1500px x 500px)
  * Twitter Profile Picture (400px x 400px)
  * Linkedin Post Header Image (1200px x 644px)
